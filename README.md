Nice 🚀 — I see you’ve added **binary-search.cpp** and **binarysearchtree.cpp** to your repo along with your existing DSA files. Let me now give you a **complete, upgraded README** that documents everything clearly and looks professional.

✨ Now your README reflects **binary search + binary search tree** additions and looks like a professional **DSA archive repo**.

Do you want me to also add a **small example code snippet** (like how binary search works) inside the README for extra clarity?
